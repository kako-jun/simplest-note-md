### Agasteer-Specific Commands

| Command | Action                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `:w`    | Push to GitHub (save)           |
| `:q`    | Navigate to parent note (close) |
| `:wq`   | Save and close                  |

## Two-Pane Behavior

- Vim mode operates independently in left and right panes
- Use `<Space>` to switch between left and right panes
- Commands can be executed independently in each pane
