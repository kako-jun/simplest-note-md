How to navigate between screens.

## Breadcrumbs

Your current location is displayed at the top of the screen.

`Home > Note1 > Sub-note > Leaf1`

Tap any item to navigate to that level.

## Return to Home

- Tap the title "Agasteer" in the top-left header
- This always takes you back to the home screen, no matter where you are

## Browser Back/Forward

URL-based routing means you can use the browser's back/forward buttons. Bookmarking is also possible.

## Open in New Tab

**Ctrl+click** (or **middle-click**) on a note or leaf title to open it in a new tab. Useful when you want to view multiple notes at once.
