# Note Operations

How to create, edit, and delete notes, which act like folders.

## Relationship Between Notes and Leaves

Agasteer manages memos in a 2-level structure.

```
Home
├── Note (folder)
│   ├── Leaf (memo)
│   ├── Leaf
│   └── Sub-note (folder)
│       ├── Leaf
│       └── Leaf
└── Note
    └── Leaf
```

- **Note**: Acts like a folder. Maximum 2 levels (Note → Sub-note)
- **Leaf**: The actual Markdown file. Where you write memos

---

## Create

1. On the home screen, tap the "**+folder**" button
2. Enter a note name and tap "Create"

Inside a note, you can also create sub-notes with the "**+folder**" button (up to 2 levels).

---

## Rename

1. Open the note
2. Tap the pencil icon next to the note name in the breadcrumb (`Home > Note Name`) at the top of the screen
3. Enter a new name and press Enter

---

## Reorder

**Drag and drop** note cards to reorder them as you like.

---

## Move

You can move notes to another note.

1. Open the note
2. Tap the "Move" button in the footer
3. Select the destination note (or "Home")
4. Tap "Move"

> **Note**: You can move sub-notes to root or move root notes into sub-notes.

---

## Delete

1. Open the note
2. Tap the trash button in the footer
3. Tap "OK" in the confirmation dialog

> **Note**: Deleting a note also deletes all sub-notes and leaves inside it.
