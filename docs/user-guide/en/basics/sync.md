How to save to GitHub (Push) and retrieve from GitHub (Pull).

---

## Saving to GitHub (Push)

If you've set up GitHub integration, you can save your edits to GitHub.

### How to Save

- Tap the "💾" button in the footer
- Or press **Ctrl+S** (Mac: **Cmd+S**)

### Unsaved Changes

When there are unsaved changes, a **red dot** appears on the save button.

### Stale Warning

If edits were made on another device, a warning appears before Push. You can choose to overwrite or Pull first.

---

## Retrieving from GitHub (Pull)

Sync the latest data from GitHub to your browser.

### How to Pull

- Tap the "⬇️" button on the left side of the header
- In the PWA version, there's no reload button, so use this button to Pull

### Auto Pull

Pull is automatically executed when the app starts.

### Background Check

Remote changes are automatically checked every 5 minutes. If there are new changes, a red dot appears on the Pull button.

## Data Protection Features

### Page Exit Confirmation

If you try to close the tab or reload while there are unsaved changes, a browser confirmation dialog appears.

- Prevents accidentally losing changes
- Does not appear during in-app navigation (due to auto-save)

### Stale Progress Bar

A thin vertical line (progress bar) is displayed on the left edge of the header.

- Automatically checks for remote changes **every 5 minutes**
- Bar extends from top to bottom; check runs when full
- If changes were made on another device, a red dot appears on the Pull button

> **Tip**: Manual Pull/Push resets the countdown to the next check.

### Read-Only Mode During Pull

During Pull, a semi-transparent overlay (glass effect) covers the editing area, preventing edits.

- To maintain data consistency
- Offline leaves are an exception (editable even during Pull)
