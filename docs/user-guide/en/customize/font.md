## Default Font (BIZ UDGothic)

When no custom font is set, **BIZ UDGothic** (monospace font) is automatically used.

### Features

- Auto-downloaded from Google Fonts
- Cached in IndexedDB, so fast from the second load
- Applied to editor and code blocks

> **Tip**: As a Japanese monospace font, Markdown tables and code align nicely.

- `.otf` (OpenType)
- `.woff` / `.woff2` (Web Font)
