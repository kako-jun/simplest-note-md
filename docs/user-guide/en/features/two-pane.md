# Two-Pane Display

On landscape screens, content is displayed in two side-by-side panes.

---

## When Does Two-Pane Activate?

- **Auto-detection**: Automatically switches to two-pane when screen width > height
- Rotating your phone to landscape activates two-pane mode
- Portrait screens always show single pane

---

## Open Different Content in Each Pane

- Left: note list, Right: edit a leaf
- Left: reference material, Right: leaf you're writing
- View different notes simultaneously in left and right panes

### When Same Leaf is Open in Both Panes

- **Edits sync instantly** (type in one → reflected in the other)
- **Scroll position also syncs**
- Left: edit mode, Right: preview → Check your writing as you go
