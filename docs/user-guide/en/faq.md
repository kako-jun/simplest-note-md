## Basic Questions

### Q: Do I need a server?

**A:** No, it runs entirely in the browser. It can be hosted on static hosting (Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, etc.).

### Q: Can I use it offline?

**A:** Yes, once loaded you can edit offline. However, GitHub sync requires an internet connection.

### Q: Does it work on mobile?

**A:** Yes, with responsive design it works comfortably on smartphones. With PWA support, you can add it to your home screen and use it like a native app.

### Q: Is GitHub integration required?

**A:** Yes, GitHub integration is required to create notes and leaves. Enter your repository name and token in the settings screen and perform a Pull to get started.

## Data Management

### Q: Where is my data stored?

**A:** In 3 locations:

| Data                | Storage Location             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Notes & Leaves      | IndexedDB (browser) + GitHub |
| Settings            | LocalStorage (browser)       |
| Fonts & Backgrounds | IndexedDB (browser only)     |

### Q: Can I import existing Markdown files?

**A:** Yes, there are 2 ways:

1. **Import feature**: Import Agasteer format (ZIP) or SimpleNote format (JSON) from the settings screen
2. **Manual placement**: Place Markdown files in `.agasteer/notes/` on GitHub and perform a Pull

### Q: Do I need to backup my data?

**A:** Recommended. IndexedDB can be cleared when you clear browser cache.

- Set up GitHub sync for backup
- Export to save locally

### Q: Can I have more than 2 levels of note hierarchy?

**A:** No, it's limited to 2 levels (Note → Sub-note). This is by design to keep things simple.

## Sync

### Q: Can I sync across multiple devices?

**A:** Yes, you can sync by Pull/Push to the same GitHub repository.

**Note**: Conflict resolution UI is not yet implemented. If you edit simultaneously on multiple devices, the data from the later Push will overwrite.

### Q: How much does it cost?

**A:** GitHub's free plan is sufficient.

| Usage Pattern | Pull/Push Count | Cost     |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Light usage   | ~30/month       | **Free** |
| Normal usage  | ~100/month      | **Free** |
| Heavy usage   | ~300/month      | **Free** |

No cost as long as you stay within GitHub API rate limits (5,000 requests/hour).

## Images & Media

### Q: Can I embed images?

**A:** Markdown image syntax works, but there's no image upload feature.

Methods:

1. Place images in `images/` on GitHub and reference with `![description](./images/example.png)`
2. Use an external image hosting service (Imgur, etc.)

### Q: Can I embed videos or audio?

**A:** Yes, by using HTML tags in Markdown.

```html
<video src="https://example.com/video.mp4" controls></video>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Push is failing

Check the following:

1. Is the GitHub Token correct?
2. Does the token have the `repo` scope (or Contents: Read and write)?
3. Is the repository name in `owner/repo` format?
4. Has the token expired?

### Q: Pull is failing

Check the following:

1. Is the GitHub Token correct?
2. Is the repository name correct?
3. Does the repository exist?

### Q: My data disappeared

Possible causes:

1. You cleared browser cache
2. You were using private/incognito mode
3. You're using a different browser/profile

**Solution**: If you're using GitHub sync, perform a Pull to restore your data.

### Q: Vim mode isn't working

Check the following:

1. Is Vim mode enabled in settings?
2. Have you clicked the editor to focus it?
3. Have you pressed Esc to return to normal mode?

### Q: On Android, tapping empty lines causes scroll to jump

**A:** This is a compatibility issue with Gboard (Google Japanese Input).

Tapping empty lines (blank lines between paragraphs) may cause the scroll position to jump unexpectedly.

**Workaround**: Instead of tapping empty lines, tap a line with text and then move the cursor.

### Q: What's the vertical line on the left side of the header?

**A:** It's a progress bar showing time until the next stale check.

- Automatically checks for remote changes every 5 minutes
- When the bar is full (5 minutes elapsed), a check is performed
- If changes were made on another device, a red dot appears on the Pull button
